The Author
----------

Born in Taiwan, 1938; lived in Japan, 1945-1958; started piano lessons in 1949,
then received a BS degree from RPI, Troy, NY (1962), and Ph. D. in Physics from
Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (1967), USA. Worked as analytical research scientist,
1967-1998, mostly with the Bell Telephone companies in NJ. This book originated
from my observations on the methods of Mlle. Yvonne Combe, who taught our two
daughters. While writing it, I discovered that piano pedagogy had never been
researched, documented, and analyzed properly; therefore, this book is my
attempt at correcting that deficiency. Although this book is the best teaching
aid available now, this book demonstrates that it is not a finished product: it
is just a beginning.


The Project

This is Sphinx adaptation of Chuan C. Chang's excellent book, `Fundamentals of
Piano Practice`_. Why bother? Well there are a quite few formatting
improvements from the original PDF, including inter-document links, clean
bulleted lists, and improved font/line spacing. By virtue of being a Sphinx
project, this book is also available in HTML, PDF, ePub, and LaTeX. As a GitHub
project, anyone can contribute to this project by adding in content from the
book and fixing any discrepancies in formatting.
